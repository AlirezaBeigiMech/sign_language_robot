## BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL imports
##
## To use the Python MoveIt! interfaces, we will import the `moveit_commander`_ namespace.
## This namespace provides us with a `MoveGroupCommander`_ class, a `PlanningSceneInterface`_ class,
## and a `RobotCommander`_ class. (More on these below)
##
## We also import `rospy`_ and some messages that we will use:
##

import rospy
import math
import moveit_commander
import moveit_msgs.msg
import geometry_msgs.msg
from math import pi
from std_msgs.msg import String
from moveit_commander.conversions import pose_to_list

    ## First initialize `moveit_commander`_ and a `rospy`_ node:
    moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
    rospy.init_node('move_group_python_interface_tutorial',
                    anonymous=True)

    ## Instantiate a `RobotCommander`_ object. This object is the outer-level interface to
    ## the robot:
    robot = moveit_commander.RobotCommander()

    ## Instantiate a `PlanningSceneInterface`_ object.  This object is an interface
    ## to the world surrounding the robot:
    scene = moveit_commander.PlanningSceneInterface()

    ## Instantiate a `MoveGroupCommander`_ object.  This object is an interface
    ## to one group of joints.  In this case the group is the joints in the Panda
    ## arm so we set ``group_name = panda_arm``. If you are using a different robot,
    ## you should change this value to the name of your robot arm planning group.
    ## This interface can be used to plan and execute motions on the Panda:
    group_name = "dual_arms"
    group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander(group_name)

    ## We create a `DisplayTrajectory`_ publisher which is used later to publish
    ## trajectories for RViz to visualize:
    display_trajectory_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/move_group/display_planned_path',
                                                   moveit_msgs.msg.DisplayTrajectory,
